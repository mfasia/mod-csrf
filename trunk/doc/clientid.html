  <p>
mod_clientid may be used to create a session secret which is stored at 
the browser within a <i>Cookie</i>. The module tries to ensure that this 
cookie is only used by the client it has been issued for by locking it 
to additional client attributes:
<ul>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>SSL session id</li>
<li>Browser fingerprint (based on content of the the User-Agent, Accept-Language, 
and Accept-Encoding HTTP headers as well as the ciphers used fot the 
SSL session).
</ul>
Locking is enfored by allowing the client to change only those attributes 
at the same time which have been defined by the 
<a title="CLID_Require" href="#CLID_Require">CLID_Require</a> directive. If all the specified 
attributes change, the client is verified by redirecting it to 
<a title="CLID_Check" href="#CLID_Check">pre-defined</a> URL checking validating 
if the browser does still known the ETag for this URL.

<ul>
<a name="CLID_Cookie"></a>
<li><code>CLID_Cookie &lt;secret&gt; &lt;cookie name&gt; &lt;check path&gt;</code><br/>
Enables the module by defining a secret for data encryption, a name 
for to cookie used to store the client attributes as well as its 
secret, and an URL path which is used to verify the client 
accepts cookies.
</li>
<a name="CLID_Check"></a>
<li><code>CLID_Check &lt;path&gt;</code><br/>
Defines the path of the URL where the ETag is set/verified.
</li>
<a name="CLID_Require"></a>
<li><code>CLID_Require &lt;attribute&gt;</code><br/>
Specifies the client attributes which must not change at the very same 
time/request. Client sessions whose attributes change within the same 
request are validated using the ETag. Available attributes are 
'ip', 'ssl', and 'fp'.
</li>
<a name="CLID_SemFile"></a>
<li><code>CLID_SemFile &lt;path&gt;</code><br/>
File path wihin the server's file system to create the lock file 
for semaphore/mutex.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Module Variables</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<code>CLID_RND</code> <br/>
