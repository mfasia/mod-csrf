general:
- how to handle exceptions?
  + don't enforce certain urls (static content)
  + enforced for any request having "arguments" only (query, form post, multipart, json, ...)
- sorry page (to continue with start page)
- no application specific settings (fully automatic)
- "classic" csrf (link/script embedded within a web page) vs. other types of link distribution (e.g. by email, within a document, application, ...) (redirect to initial page)

A) add an "unique_id" to each request (having args)
- unique_id (per user's session):
  - short lived
  - hash user name/id (r->user) if available
  - optional: hash ip address (mask/range)
  - session/user cookie (QS_UserTrackingCookieName)
  - encrypt the whole (can't be generated by anybody else)
  - sent by a header field (not embedded within the page)? split id (header, html, js)?
- variant A: inject java script which adds unique_id
  - dom tree update: to all html forms in order to protect POST requests
    -> simple
  - to all references (at least those having a query)
    -> difficult to implement by JS?
       performance?
       page reload
       what if page not loaded completely?
- variant B: inject java script which adds unique_id
  - to each http request performed by the browser
    -> on every send request (content within the page (no user interaction/ajax support))
    -> leave page (issued by the user)
- variant C: plugin adds unique_id
  - to each http request performed by the browser
    -> we can't support all browsers

B) milestones
- user must visit previous page

C) referer header
- "classic" csrf only using referer/origin header
